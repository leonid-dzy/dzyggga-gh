## Professional Summary

Hands-on Front-End Architect delivering high-performance solutions since 2012. I operate across two domains: modernizing enterprise monoliths (specializing in SFCC) and architecting AI-first, serverless platforms (Next.js, Edge Computing). As an active Principal Engineer, I lead by coding the most complex system components. My philosophy treats Performance, Accessibility (AA), Security (Zero-Trust), and Semantic SEO as non-negotiable architectural constraints.

I maintain an infinite learning loop to ensure solutions meet current best practices. Even if a technology is not required by my current project, I utilize my personal time with resources like Frontend Masters, architecting solutions with Gemini Ultra, and deep-diving into FE technical documentation. I excel at creating precise technical documentation and am adept at investigating and reverse-engineering existing codebases when documentation is incomplete.
