## **Professional Profile**

**Hands-on Front-End Architect** delivering high-performance solutions **since 2012**. I specialize in bridging legacy enterprise systems (SFCC) with modern reactive architectures (Next.js, React, Serverless).

* **Active Principal Engineer:** I actively write, review, and optimize code, handling the most complex technical challenges personally rather than just managing.
* **Foundational Quality (Shift-Left):** I architect systems with **RTL (Right-to-Left), Accessibility (WCAG AA), Semantic SEO, and Performance** as core constraints from the very first line of code—never as an afterthought.
* **Innovation Leader:** Currently building AI-first serverless platforms while simultaneously modernizing global luxury retail architectures.
* **Security & UX Focused:** Deep understanding of web security vectors and User Experience patterns, ensuring solutions are safe, frictionless, and scalable.

## **Continuous Evolution & AI Workflow**

*In the Front-End world, best practices change weekly and features deprecate in months. My motivation is to always provide the current best-performance solution.*

* **Continuous Learning:** I maintain an infinite learning loop (utilizing resources like **Frontend Masters**) before *and* after every task to ensure implementation aligns with the latest standards, not just "what worked last year."
* **AI-First Development:** I have moved beyond standard GitHub Copilot, utilizing **Gemini Ultra** and **Next-Gen AI IDEs** (Claude/Sonnet integration) to architect smarter, bug-free systems faster.
* **Deep Browser Engineering:** I don't just use frameworks; I master the browser. I possess deep expertise in **Canvas, Web Workers, Service Workers**, and low-level Browser APIs (**History, Navigator, Proxy, Promise**).

## **Technical Strategy & Framework Philosophy**

*My approach to selecting the right tool for the team:*

* **Angular:** My preferred choice for mixed-seniority teams. I leverage its strict patterns and opinionated structure to prevent architectural drift and ensure junior developers produce safe, maintainable code.
* **React:** I deploy React for senior, high-velocity teams who deeply understand the Virtual DOM, reactivity, and component lifecycles. I focus on establishing strong conventions to manage its inherent flexibility.
* **Vue.js:** I utilize Vue as a balanced compromise—offering more structure than React but less boilerplate than Angular—ideal for rapid prototyping and pragmatic delivery.

## **Key Architectural & Engineering Achievements**

### **1. Modernization of Luxury Retail Ecosystem (Dior / Alpenite)**
*Role: Front-End Architect & Team Lead*

* **Hybrid Architecture (SFRA + Modern JS):** Architected a custom framework utilizing **Light DOM** to hydrate Server-Side Rendered (SSR) SFRA code with modern JavaScript components.
* **Performance Engineering:** Heavily implemented **Dynamic Imports** to split code execution, ensuring features load only when needed. Solved complex loading issues for video (Freecaster lib) with lazy-loading strategies and custom splash image composition tools.
* **Infrastructure Overhaul:** Led the critical upgrade of the Node.js environment (v12 → v18+). Migrated build pipelines from Webpack to **Rspack** and implemented **PNPM** to manage complex cartridge dependencies, reducing build times by >60%.
* **Fintech Integration:** Designed and built custom, secure payment integrations for **Apple Pay** and **PayPal**, bypassing standard cartridge limitations to meet specific market needs.
* **Team Standards:** Enforced strict documentation and loading process controls. While leading the team, I remained the primary contributor for critical blockers and complex logic implementation.

### **2. Complex UI Engineering & Gamification (Golden Goose)**
*Role: Senior Developer*

* **Physics-Based Gamification:** Engineered a complex **"Gift Finder" Roulette** module using Vue.js embedded within SFCC.
    * Implemented custom logic for drag-and-drop spinning mechanics.
    * Calculated rotation power based on user view/gesture velocity.
    * Built a stepped randomizer algorithm to deterministically yet organically select products.
* **Content Systems:** Created a scalable Page Designer ecosystem, allowing marketing teams to build custom layouts without developer intervention.

### **3. Next-Gen AI E-Commerce Platform (Scootify.eco)**
*Role: Founder & Principal Architect (Current)*

* **Platform Migration:** Leading the strategic migration from Shopify to a custom **AI-first, Serverless** solution powered by **Next.js**.
* **Full-Stack Implementation:** Building a scalable architecture that leverages Edge computing for speed and AI agents for customer interaction.
* **Security:** Designed security protocols from the ground up, focusing on secure API communication and friction-less user experience.

### **4. R&D and Framework Evolution (Dzyggga / Stryzhavka Online)**
*Role: Creator & Full-Stack Developer*

* **Multi-Framework Evolution:** Demonstrated adaptability by evolving the *Stryzhavka* project through multiple iterations: initially built on **Vue.js**, migrated to **React**, and finalized on **Angular** before handing over to government administration.
* **Cloud & Data:** Built the *Dzyggga* platform using React and **GCP**, focusing on high-performance data handling before sunsetting the project to focus on modern serverless stacks.
