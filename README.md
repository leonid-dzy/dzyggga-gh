## Professional Summary

Hands-on Front-End Architect delivering high-performance solutions since 2012. I operate across two domains: modernizing enterprise monoliths (Salesforce Commerce Cloud) and architecting AI-first, serverless platforms. As an active Principal Engineer, I lead by coding the most complex system components myself. My philosophy treats Performance, Accessibility (AA), Security (Zero-Trust), and Semantic SEO as non-negotiable architectural constraints.

**AI Philosophy & Workflow:** I leverage Enterprise AI (Gemini Ultra) as a strategic force multiplier—using it to brainstorm, generate documentation, manipulate assets, and accelerate routine coding. This approach allows me to delegate simple tasks to agents and focus my energy on complex architectural challenges. I treat AI like a high-performance vehicle: it speeds up the journey, but I remain the driver—ensuring strict data privacy (Enterprise-only), rigorously reviewing every line of generated code, and using the process to continuously expand my own vocabulary and technical knowledge.
